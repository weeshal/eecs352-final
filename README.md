### Motivation
Most people have at some point in their life struggled with a song being stuck in their head, and no options to find out what its called. With most commercial systems these days, only when the song is played in real-time would it be able to recognize it and label it with the title. No definitive method exists to query a song by humming, even though a number of research papers have been written on said topic. We believe the chorus is the most distinguishable part of a song, and is the melody that is most likely to be ingrained into a listener's mind.
